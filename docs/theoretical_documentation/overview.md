# Overview

The theoretical documentation provides a slightly more in-depth review of the workings of the thermal transformer model.
On the following pages more information can be found:

- [Transformer definition](transformer_definition.md): General introduction to transformers.
- [Model description](model_description.md): introduction to the thermal modelling of transformers and the equations
used in the package.
- [Thermal limits](temperature_limits.md): definitions of thermal limits as prescribed by the loading guide.
- [Model input](../get_started/model_input.md): Detailed descriptions of all the transformer specifications needed for thermal
modelling.
- [Hot-spot factor calibration](hotspot_calibration.md): method for determining the hot-spot factor when unknown.
- [Potential model improvements](model_improvements.md): Ideas for increasing model accuracy that have not yet been
implemented.

Relevant standards:

- IEC 60076-1: Power transformers - General;
- IEC 60076-2: Power transformers - Temperature rise for liquid-immersed transformers;
- IEC 60076-7: Power transformers - Loading guide for mineral-oil-immersed power transformers;
- IEC 60214: On-load tap-changers;
- IEC 60137: Insulated bushings for alternating voltages above 1000 V.
