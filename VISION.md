### _We believe in making optimal use of our grid, so that electricity can remain as affordable, reliable, and accessible as possible._


### **We will achieve this by:**
- **working in a modular way** and breaking down major challenges into smaller solutions;
- implementing these solutions in a **pragmatic and effective** manner;
- contributing to the assessment of the trade-off between **acceptable risk and customer satisfaction**;
- initiating and driving **national collaboration** in this field;
- continuing to approach problem statements with our **technical expertise** and experience;
- Determining the thermal capacity of our assets.

### **What does our transformer thermal model deliver that aligns with this way of working?**

_Modular working_
- Single-responsibility principle: facilitating risk assessment when thermally loading transformers beyond nominal conditions;
- extensive interfacing for specific transformer configurations;
- simulation of top-oil and hot-spot temperatures in transformers;
- a standard interface with (IEC-standard-based) standard transformer configurations for conservative modelling in the absence of asset data.


_Contribution to risk management and customer satisfaction_
- determining paper ageing within a transformer.

_National collaboration_
- by making the package open-source;
- by being active on our open-source repository;
- clear documentation with simple, step-by-step code examples;
- a toolbox that facilitates integration between commonly used tools (e.g. pandas) and our package.

_Technical expertise_
- measurements and reporting on assets in the field;
- validation of the model through load tests;
- IEC-standard-based hot-spot factor calibration as a fallback method when measurements are unavailable.

_Pragmatic and effective_
- vectorisation and short computation times;
- minimal use of large-scale AI in and around the product;
- continuous quality checks on the code;
- a methodology based on an internationally recognised standard (IEC 60076-7);
- input based on FAT measurement data;
- “good” is good enough.
